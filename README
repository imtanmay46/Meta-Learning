INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN & DESCRIPTION OF FILE CONTENTS:

1. Run the pre-installs.py file to download/resolve all the dependency issues. This will also create two directories, 'data' (used to download & store the data using wget (github))
   & the 'saved_models' directory that will download the pickle files of the trained models from the publicly accessible google drive link using gdown & store them (to be used in validation & prediction files).
2. Run the models.py present inside the Models directory to initialize the model to be used in the training files.
3. Run the train.ipynb or train.py to train the models & overwrite the downloaded pickles. If google drive pickle files are to be used after this, re-run pre-installs.
4. Run the validation.ipynb or validation.py to evaluate the trained/saved models on the meta-testing set.
5. Run the predict.ipynb or predict.py for evaluation on the entire evaluation set publicly available!
